# Skyworks 🚁🌍

Skyworks is a web-based platform that allows users to input geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and send these commands to an autonomous drone. The drone receives the destination data and navigates to the specified location autonomously. In addition, the system provides real-time tracking of the drone's location.

## 🔧 Features

- 🌐 User-friendly web interface for entering coordinates
- 📡 Real-time communication with the drone
- 🤖 Autonomous drone navigation to specified coordinates
- 📍 Live drone tracking on the map
- ✅ Responsive and interactive user experience

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters the desired **latitude** and **longitude** on the Skyworks platform.
2. **Command Transmission**: The input coordinates are sent to the drone using a backend service.
3. **Autonomous Navigation**: The drone receives the command and autonomously travels to the specified location using GPS.
4. **Live Tracking**: The current location of the drone is updated and displayed on the website for live tracking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js / Flask (based on your implementation)
- **Map & Tracking**: Google Maps API / Leaflet.js
- **Drone Communication**: Serial / HTTP / MQTT (depending on implementation)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages / Heroku / AWS / Custom Server
